## Getting Started

**Load packages required for exercises:**

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(readr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(choroplethr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(choroplethrMaps))
```


**Load the data**

```{r}
#this uses the readr library:
elect <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tonmcg/County_Level_Election_Results_12-16/master/US_County_Level_Presidential_Results_08-16.csv")
```



<br>
<br>


## Pre-Bootcamp Review

### Exercise 1: Explore the structure of the data

```{r}
#Check out the first rows of `elect`.  What are the cases?  The variables?    
    
#How much data do we have?    
    
#What are the names of the variables?    
    
#How can we subset just the `dem_2016` data?    
    
#How can we filter out only the counties in which more than 25,000 people voted in 2016?    
    
```
    


<br>
<br>

### Exercise 2: Create new variables


```{r}
#start with 1 variable to get the hang of it

        
#now 2 variables    


#now 3.  (why do we put winrep_2016 in its own row?!)


#finally, add all 2012 and 2016 variables and store as 'elect'


```
        


<br>
<br>

### Exercise 3: Explore the win column

```{r}
#Construct a table (a numerical summary) of the number of counties that Trump won/lost

#Construct a bar chart (a visual summary) of this variable.    

```





<br>
<br>

### Exercise 4: Visually explore vote percentages

```{r}
#histogram

#density plot

```



<br>
<br>

### Exercise 5: Numerically summarize vote percentages

```{r}
#calculate the mean Trump support

#calculate the median Trump support

#calculate the variance in Trump support from county to county

#calculate the standard deviation in Trump support from county to county

#use the 68-95-99.7 Rule to approximate the range of from the 2.5th to 97.5th percentiles of  Trump support

#calculate the exact 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles 
```


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


## Explaining Variability + Wrangling


**Load the data:**

```{r warning=FALSE}
#load demographic data from the choroplethr library
data("df_county_demographics")
head(df_county_demographics,3)

#load RedBluePurple data
RedBlue <- read.csv("https://www.macalester.edu/~ajohns24/Data/RedBluePurple.csv")
head(RedBlue,3)
```



<br>
<br>

**Join / merge these data tables into a single data set:**

```{r}
#define "region" variable

#join elect and df_county_demographics (from dplyr)

#join the new fulldata with RedBlue

#check out the names of fulldata

```


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


## Visualizing Relationships

### Exercise 6: Scatterplots of 2 quantitative variables


```{r}
#just a graphics frame

#adding a scatterplot layer


#another predictor


#another predictor

```
    
    
   
<br>
<br>

### Exercise 7: Side-by-side plots of 1 quantitative variable vs 1 categorical variable


```{r}
#density plots by group

#to see better: add transparency


#to see better: split groups into separate plots


#violins instead


#boxes instead


```



<br>
<br>


### Exercise 8: Scatterplots of 1 quantitative variable vs 1 categorical & 1 quantitative variable


```{r}
#scatterplot: id groups using color


#scatterplot: id groups using shape


#scatterplot: split/facet by group


```



<br>
<br>


### Exercise 9: Side-by-side plots of 1 quantitative variable vs 2 categorical variables

```{r}
#density plots by group combo


#switch faceting order


```

<br>
<br>

### Exercise 10: Plots of 3 quantitative variables

```{r}
#scatterplot: represent third variable using color


#scatterplot: discretize the third variable into 2 groups & represent with color


#scatterplot: discretize the third variable into 2 groups & facet by group


```


    
<br>
<br>


### Exercise 11: Maps!

```{r}
#Construct maps using the choroplethrMaps library

#a map of Trump support


#a map of Trump wins


#a map of percent white


```




<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>



## Linear Regression Models

### Exercise 12: Models with 1 quantitative predictor


```{r}
#visualization

#model

```


<br> 
<br>

### Exercise 13: Models with 1 categorical predictor

```{r}
#plot the relationship

```


```{r}
#detach/unload libraries (a bug)
detach(package:choroplethr)
detach(package:acs)
detach(package:plyr)

#calculate the group means

```



```{r}
#construct the model

```



<br>        
<br>

### Exercise 14: Models with 1 quantitative predictor & 1 categorical predictor


```{r}
#visualize the relationship

#construct the model

```



<br>
<br>


### Exercise 15: Models with 2 quantitative predictors

```{r}
#visualize the relationship

#construct the model


```



<br> 
<br>

### Exercise 16: Models with 2 categorical predictors

```{r}
#create income brackets

```

```{r}
#visualize the relationship

#construct the model

```
